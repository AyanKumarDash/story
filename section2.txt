Section 2: The Twisted Terms

Inside the mansion, Mr. Jenkins discovered a videotape left behind by his uncle. Eager to uncover the truth behind his inheritance, he hastily inserted it into an old VCR. The flickering screen revealed his uncle, adorned in a ridiculous clown costume, delivering a message.

"Ah, dear nephew, if you're watching this, it means I've left you everything. But it comes with a catch! You must spend an entire year living in this mansion without leaving its premises. Each room has its own bizarre challenge. If you succeed, the fortune is yours. If not, well, let's just say I've ensured your life will be even more of a tragic comedy!"

Dumbfounded, Mr. Jenkins realized his inheritance was nothing short of a dark, twisted game set up by his wicked uncle. With no choice but to accept the challenge, he set forth to navigate the labyrinthine mansion, unaware of the absurd obstacles that awaited him.
